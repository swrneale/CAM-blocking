\section{Introduction}
Introduction

\section{Section 1}

A number of modifications have been implemented in CAM4, the most impactful of which are summarized below. A more comprehensive description of CAM4 can be found in \citet{CAM4_TN}.

\subsection{Blocking Diagnostics}
\subsubsection{Frequency}
\subsubsection{Strength}

\subsection{Period Length}

\subsection{Composite Events}
Knowing the distribution of blocking and baroclinic strength as shown in \label{} we are able to evaluate composite events based on the an average of the top (blocked) and bottom (baroclinic) 10\% Z500 strength days for each mean blocking maximum region (European and Pacific blocking centers).In Winter all model versions are able to capture the Western zonal extent of the composite Z500 block pattern, this is despite gettting the frequency of these blocking events correct. The models correctly reprduce associated l

-Remember these composites only show what the top/bottom percentile events look like not they are stronger or occur more frequently in CAM5/MAM for example. But maybe one would expect CAM5 in winter to have a stronger spring pattern?

-Both baroclinic and barotropic composite anomalies are of equal strength at zero lag, but blocking anomalies remain much larger at -/+ 5 days indicating the longer persistance of blocking events in both observations and all versions of CAM.

-In CAM the blocking centers seem to grow and decay in situ over the European region five days prior to and following the lag-zero blcoking. This is in contrast to ERAI where the blocking center is located in the central Atlantic five days prior to the zero lag day and then decays in-situ north of the UK.

-REMEMBER: Blocking improves in MAM, not so much in DJF, so there should not really be an expectation of differences in DJF really.

-In DJF the strongest circulation features over the USA are seen with a lag of -3 days. This is not
